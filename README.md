# Seven Segment Display
#### Introductory Arduino Project by Nicholas Cutler


## Description
**Simple Experimental Project**
This project was aimed at understanding the functionality of a seven segment display and how to interact with it. To do this, I chose to program a simple WiFi clock that contacts an NTP server, parses the provided time, and displays it as a decimal value on the seven segment display. This project was built on an Arduino MKR 1000 WiFi
